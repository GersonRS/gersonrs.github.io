- During my time as a Substitute Professor at UFRPE, I had the privilege of teaching a diverse range of subjects to students enrolled in the "Sistemas de Informação" (Information Systems) course. The courses I taught included "Instrumentação para Ensino" (Teaching Instrumentation), "Laboratório de Programação" (Programming Laboratory), "Processos de Desenvolvimento de Software" (Software Development Processes), "Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados" (Algorithms and Data Structures), "Introdução a Informática" (Introduction to Informatics), and "Infraestrutura de Hardware" (Hardware Infrastructure).

- I took a student-centered approach, creating engaging and interactive learning experiences to help students grasp complex concepts effectively. It was rewarding to witness their growth and enthusiasm for the subjects as they honed their skills and knowledge in the field of Information Systems. My time as a Substitute Professor at UFRPE enriched my teaching abilities and reinforced my passion for education and empowering students in their academic journey.
