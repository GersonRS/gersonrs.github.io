- During my time as a Substitute Professor at IFPB, I had the privilege of teaching various subjects, including "Administração de Sistemas Operacionais Proprietário e Abertos" (Administration of Proprietary and Open Operating Systems), "Introdução a Programação" (Introduction to Programming), and "Gestão de Projetos" (Project Management) to students enrolled in the technical courses of Integrated and Subsequent education in "Manutenção e Suporte a Informática" (Maintenance and Support in Informatics).

- I took a forward-thinking approach to teaching by incorporating innovative learning tools and methodologies to engage my students. I utilized platforms such as Scratch, AppInventor, and unplugged activities to foster a dynamic and interactive learning environment. It was a fulfilling experience to witness my students' growth and enthusiasm for the subjects, and I am proud to have contributed to their educational journey during my tenure as a Substitute Professor at IFPB.
