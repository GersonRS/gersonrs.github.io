Hello! I got introduced to programming during my freshman year at [UFRPE - UAST](http://www.uast.ufrpe.br/), where I completed my undergraduate degree in Information Systems and later pursued my master's in Applied Informatics, achieving the [highest distinction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cx-mqGDGHTt1wHMShaDM396_Uj-anqjv/view?usp=sharing).

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at [CESAR](https://www.cesar.org.br/), involved in all project stages, from conception to evaluation and testing, ensuring high-quality deliveries. My expertise includes proposing data-driven solutions using AI, refining existing processes, and deriving valuable insights for the business.

Besides my work at CESAR, I also have experience as a professor at [CESAR SCHOOL](https://www.cesar.school/), sharing my knowledge and contributing to the education of future professionals in the field of Information Systems and Software Development. I continuously strive to stay at the cutting edge of creating innovative and complex solutions for the projects I am involved in.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
